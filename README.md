# Dungeon Adventure

**Dungeon**: You need a general class that encapsulates the entire concept of the dungeon game.

**Player**: The player provides the link between the dungeon and you. All experience of the dungeon comes through the player. The player can move between rooms in the dungeon.

**Rooms**: The rooms of the dungeon are the locations that the player can navigate between. These will be linked together in multiple ways (doors to the north, west, east, and south, for example) and have descriptions. â€¨
